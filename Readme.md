## TACL GUI 鬼
### What is the TACL GUI?

Quoted from the TACL GUI manual:

> The TACL GUI, as the name suggests, is a GUI (Graphic User Interface, i.e. point-and-click interface
of the type most users are used to for most computer programmes) for the use of "TACL". "TACL" is
a tool for the computer-assisted analysis of digitised texts in the Chinese Buddhist canon. The name
"TACL" is a "backronym" motivated mainly by a love of puns, and it doesn't really matter what it
stands for. Interested users can contact us with suggestions for fun interpretations; users who
prefer to have answers can think of it as meaning "Text And Corpus Lab".

Please consult the TACL GUI Manual (Download link follows) for detailed information.

### Technical Requirements
- Currently, the TACL GUI is available both for Windows and Linux (a Mac version will follow soon).
